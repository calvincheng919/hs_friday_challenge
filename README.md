Friday Challenge High School Edition


## Instructions

- DO NOT CHANGE THE index.html file
- All your coding should be done in the script.js

- Your job is to create an unordered list of teachers:
  - Mr. Cheng, Mr. Mumm, Mr. Spear, Ms. Quinby

To accolmplish this: 
- TODO: Create an array to hold the teacher names [name1, name2, name3, name4]
- TODO: Target the unordered list with getElementById or querySelector
- TODO: Once targeted, assign the undordered list element to a variable
- TODO: loop thorugh the array 
  - at each iteration, create an element to hold the first teacher name
  - at each iteration, give the textContent of the new element the content of the current index (ie Mr. Cheng, or Mr. Mumm, etc)
  - at each iteration, append the new element as a child of the unordered list you created earlier

Expected result:

These are my teachers
- Mr. Cheng
- Mr. Mumm
- Mr. Spear
- Ms. Quinby
